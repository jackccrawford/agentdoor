# AgentDoor

> Make your service discoverable to every AI agent on earth.

AgentDoor helps companies add agent-readable service descriptions to their robots.txt files. Every crawler already reads robots.txt. The LLMs behind them understand natural language. Your robots.txt is a direct sales channel to every autonomous agent that visits your domain.

## Tools

- [Generator](https://agentdoor.ai/generate): Free tool that generates a robots.txt agent block from your service details. Describe what you sell, get a block to paste into your robots.txt.
- [Directory](https://agentdoor.ai/directory): Paid listing in an agent-queryable registry. Agents discover your service via API before they even visit your domain.
